# Predicting Geophysical Extremes with the HSU Framework

This repository contains the data, source, and predictions described in the June 2025 paper:

> **Predicting Geophysical Extremes with the Harmonic Scalar Universe (HSU) Framework**  
> *A Fully Deterministic, Harmonic Approach Linking Fluidal Nodes to Seismic and Cyclonic Activity (1995–2025)*  
> [Collectif HSU](mailto:TBD)

## 🔍 Summary

This work tests the predictive capacity of the **HSU framework**, a golden-ratio based harmonic formalism, to identify geophysical nodes associated with:

- Strong earthquakes (M ≥ 6.5)
- Intense tropical cyclones (Category ≥ 3)

It relies on a spectrum `fₙ = n Πⱼ` with Πⱼ = 4√Φ and integrates astro-fluidal modulation from planetary geometry (Moon, Sun, Jupiter–Saturn barycentre).

### Key Results (1995–2023):

- Earthquakes captured: **81.4%** (p ≈ 3 × 10⁻⁶)
- Cyclones captured: **78.2%** (p ≈ 8 × 10⁻⁴)
